Problem
----
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: 2

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step

2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

Input: 3

Output: 3

Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step

2. 1 step + 2 steps

3. 2 steps + 1 step

Solution
---------
```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n<=1) return n;
        vector<int> myways(n+1);
        myways[0]=0;
        myways[1]=1;
        myways[2]=2;
        for (int i=3; i<n+1; ++i){
            myways[i]=myways[i-1]+myways[i-2];
        }
        return myways[n];
    }
};
```
